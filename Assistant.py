"""
What can this A.I. assistant do for you?
It can send emails for you.
It can play music for you.
It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
It is capable of opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser.
It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.
Enough talk! Let's start building our own Assistant....

1 â€“ Starting VS Code. 
Start a new project and make a file called jarvis.py.

2 â€“ Defining Speak Function
The and first and foremost thing for an A.I. assistant is that it should be able to speak. To make our J.A.R.V.I.S. 
talk, we will make a function called speak().
 This function will take audio as an argument, and then, it will pronounce it.
